On this project, our client is the tourism office of Creuse (french county).
Their cinemas are declining since there is not enough people to watch movies.
For information : There is only 5 cinemas in that department (1 for around 24,000 people) and more than 50% of the locals are aged 47 and more.
The client gaves us some csv files with more than 5M lines of datas.
We had to choose some movie genres, duration, popularity etc. and create a streamlit page with some systems that would recommand 5 movies based on the one you like.

Fonctionnality :
2 recommandation systems : Vectorizer and KNN
10 movies recommanded (5 per systems) based on a selected movie
Detailed informations about all the movies (selected and recommanded)

Use :
1 - Get all the files in VScode
2 - Read the "Reco - Vecto" file
3 - Enjoy streamlit

Thanks :
To our teacher, the Creuse county and my group (3 people) to make their part ( one for the vectorizer system and 2 for a powerBI).
